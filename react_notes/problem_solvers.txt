REACT MODAL - (react-modal)
{
    Issue:
        When using this package, it throws the following aria related error in console.
        "Warning: react-modal: App element is not defined. Please use Modal.setAppElement(el) or set appElement={el}"
    Solution:
        Put the following as an attribute in the <Modal></Modal> component - ariaHideApp={false}
        <Modal isOpen={!!props.selectedOption}
            onRequestClose={props.clearSelectedOption}
            ariaHideApp={false} << THIS
            contentLabel="Selected Option"
            >
        </Modal>

    Issue:  Modal gets closed when clicked outside the modal.
    Solution:   Add the following attribute to the Modal component - shouldCloseOnOverlayClick={false}
                <Modal ... shouldCloseOnOverlayClick={false} ></Modal>

Routing/Router/Route
{
    Issue/Requirement:
        To get the current URL and pathname in React.
    Solution:
        Import "useLocation" hook from react-router-dom - this provides the pathname property that gives the current path of the application.
            import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
            const usePathname = () => {
                const location = useLocation();
                return location.pathname;
            }

    Issue/Requirement:
        Use Link without giving any path.
    Solution:
        Use # instead of giving a path and the onClick listener can be added for it.
