Class vs functional components:
{
	-	When class components are rerendered, the initial object is mutated again and again.
	-	When FCs are rerendered, a new object is created every time. This is why usestate can be updated even though it is declared as a const.
	-	Due to this timers initiated in the FCs are not automatically cleared while rerendering.
