## Routing/Router/Route

1.  ### Issue/Requirement:

    -   To get the current URL and pathname in React.

    ### Solution:

    -   Import "useLocation" hook from `react-router-dom` - this provides the pathname property that gives the current path of the application.

    ```
    	import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
    	const usePathname = () => {
    		const location = useLocation();
    		return location.pathname;
    	}
    ```

1.  ### Issue/Requirement:

    -   To use Link without giving any path.

    ### Solution:

    -   Use # instead of giving a path and the onClick listener can be added for it.
